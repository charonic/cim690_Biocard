    They say that the easiest way to get on someone's good side is to go through their stomach. Who they are is a classic mystery but at least in my case it's true. If I had to choose single flavor for the rest of my life I'd probably be miserable, but for the first month or so, eating spicy food would be great! 
     <br><br>
    However, you might be asking: William, why do you enjoy torturing yourself? What could possibly the appeal of subjecting yourself to the firey kick of capsaicin?
    
     I don't really have a scientific answer, but my current theory is I enjoy that burn. When you push yourself to consume hotter and hotter things, when you push yourself to just take one more bite of that stinging pain, when your eyes are streaming, your sweat flies down your face and you finally manage to finish your meal in triumph, that's a small victory you've accomplished. Despite the pain, despite knowing the burning would stop if only you stop and drink a glass of milk, you continued, you persevered and you conquered. Granted it's a small thing, but even small things like that can grant you confidence.</p>

    If you'd like to look at this by trying to find a deeper meaning, I've tried to explain it away. But the most likely answer is I just like to eat things that make me feel the exquisite pain that thus far only spicy food grants me. I guess that makes me a food masochist but what can you do?
    
   <br>The tounge has its reasons which reason knows nothing of...
