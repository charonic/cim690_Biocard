       <div class=col-xs-12 col-md-4><p style="text-indent: 40px">Gaming is a huge chunk of my current life. For every human there is a game out there that they will enjoy, I just happen to enjoy most of them. There are several reasons why games in all their forms consume so much of my attention: Sometime the very fantasy or concept of a game will catch eye, the story telling or immersive elements may take me to faraway lands, a game might even be good solid mindless fun or it might introduce me to people I would have other neverwise met thanks to a shared language. But the chief reason I enjoy fighting games is the competetive elements and how deep the mastery goes.</p></div>

 <p style="text-indent: 40px">This is one of the most famous moments in fighting game history. EVO has long since turned into the most prestigious tournament in the Western hemisphere and arguably the world. The elite come to this tournament to pit themselves against each other, some for the glory, others to prove a point, though most probably do it because of the prize pool.
 This clip looks so simple, two characters, Chun-Li and Ken are just fighting in a dingy subway. Ken is on death's door. Ken surges forward, paying out several attacks. The two fighters separate, Chun-Li flashes, she had weathered the storm to gain enough power to fire off her most dangerous move. It's all but over, but against all odds, Ken begins to <abbr title="a defensive technique that may prevent all damage>">parry</abbr> every single strike negating the damage. This miraculous reversal of fortune allows the Ken player to take back the round. </p>
                    
 <p> The Ken player's parry is so great because it demanded a combination of physical dexterity and an understanding of the situation that comes only with mastery.<br> </p>

 <p style="text-indent: 40px">
 First, to even parry a technique you must press forward against certain attacks and down against others within 6 frames of an attack to parry it. This means you have one tenth of a <strong>second</strong> to pull this move off, if you're off by a hair you'll eat the attack you meant to parry.. This means the Ken player input 15 (the amount of attacks in Chun-Li's technique) parries against a technique where the first of 15 attacks will hit over the span of <strong>one-sixtieth</strong> of a second, each parry after that will have a one-fifteenth of a second to parry, but the first is the true killer. It is not humanly possible to <emphasis>react</emphasis>to the first parry. So how did the Ken player pull this miraculous comeback? He essentially parried from the future by reading the situation he was in: The Ken player realized that Chun-Li was attempting to <abbr title="to deal damage through one's block">chip</abbr> him, had <strong>just</strong> acquired the necessary resources to do so and that instead of waiting for the timer to run down, granting the Chun-Li a victory due her greater health, the the player behind Chun-Li wanted to score a win right this second.</p>
 <br>
 <p>For 5 seconds, the Ken player knew the Chun-Li player heart and soul which allowed him to mount one of the most spectacular comebacks in fighting game history.</p>
<br>
<p>Competitive gaming is filled with moments like this, that surge of triumph when you outplay and outthink your foe is the reason I love video games so much.</p>
